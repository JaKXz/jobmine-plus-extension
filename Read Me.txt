oh ok....after your interview..when your employer finishes their ranking, go to your ranking page. If there's a drop-down, then it means you got ranked.

To see if you've been offered, a job, go to the applications page, see how many active applications you have. Then, go to Job Inquiry and see how many available applications you have. Add the two together and if you have more than 50, then the difference from 50 = the number of offers.
